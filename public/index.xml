      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m JotaroKujo0525, you can call me by my real name, Rain Andrew. I&amp;rsquo;m a 14 year old programmer, i just program whatever the hell i want. I code discord bots, websites and etc.
I started as a programmer when a friend in discord told me about these things called discord bots, ye the first thing i programmed was discord bots. The process is excruciating but the output is so satisfying.</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to Dio Brando&amp;rsquo;s Documentation But first, what is dio brando?
You might&amp;rsquo;ve known him in the anime JoJo&amp;rsquo;s Bizzare Adventure. Click this link for you to understand him more! I&amp;rsquo;ve made a couple of discord bots back then inspired by jojo because i think that&amp;rsquo;d be a litlle funny and to also show off them a little bit. Back then, i was relying on open-source projects to run my bots but now,i&amp;rsquo;ve learned javascript and i&amp;rsquo;m coding all of my bots now myself.</description>
