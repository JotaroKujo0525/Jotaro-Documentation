# Hello and welcome to Dio Brando's Documentation

> But first, what is dio brando?

You might've known him in the anime JoJo's Bizzare Adventure. [Click](https://jojo.fandom.com/wiki/Dio_Brando) this link for you to understand him more! I've made a couple of discord bots back then inspired by jojo because i think that'd be a litlle funny and to also show off them a little bit. Back then, i was relying on open-source projects to run my bots but now,i've learned javascript and i'm coding all of my bots now myself.
