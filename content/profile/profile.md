Hi! I'm JotaroKujo0525, you can call me by my real name, Rain Andrew. I'm a 14 year old programmer, i just program whatever the hell i want. I code discord bots, websites and etc.

I started as a programmer when a friend in discord told me about these things called **discord bots**, ye the first thing i programmed was discord bots. The process is excruciating but the output is so satisfying. I got attracted with these stuffs since then. It's peetty funny how this actually happened in a one, teeny tiny phone. In fact, i'm even writing this article right now in this very phone!

Anyways, coding is hard and fun at the same time. There's learning curves all over that you need to endure in order to become much stronger and wiser after time.

Programming taught me a lot of things, but i think the best part about it is *i'm having a lot of fun doing it*.
